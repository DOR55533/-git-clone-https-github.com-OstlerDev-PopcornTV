# Windows

1. Download a static build of FFMPEG from: http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
2. Extract the build (it should be in a .7z file).
3. Take 'ffmpeg.exe' from the bin folder that is inside the folder you just extracted and place it in the root of PopcornTV. (aka, just take ffmpeg.exe and put it in your PopcornTV folder).
4. Your done!

# Mac

1. Download a static build of FFMPEG from: http://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/ (I suggest downloading the snapshot)
2. Extract the build (it should be in a .7z file).
3. Take 'ffmpeg' and place it in the of PopcornTV folder.
4. Your done!

# Linux (Untested)

1. Either download a static build and install it the same way as you did for Mac, or attempt to install using your package manager. (http://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-linux)
