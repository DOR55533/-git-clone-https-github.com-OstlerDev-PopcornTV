## How to Clone from Github (command line)

Because the easiest way to Download and Update the project is to use Git, this method is the preferred method.

1. Install Git for your system. (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
2. Open up CMD/Terminal and navigate to the Desktop. (on a Mac enter in 'cd Desktop')
3. Type in the following command to your terminal window:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/OstlerDev/PopcornTV.git
```

## Clone using Github Application

If you are a little less adventurous or just want to take an easier route, download the Github application (they make it for Mac and Windows) then visit the repository and click the "clone in desktop" button.
